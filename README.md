## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


The project instructions were established according to the [Udacity Classroom]
(https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
